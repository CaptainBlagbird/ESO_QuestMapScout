The add-on automatically collects information about started quests.
After a while (e.g. after completing an alliance/dlc send me the data:

1. Close the game (or disable the add-on and reload the UI)

2. Find the log file "Elder Scrolls Online\XXX\SavedVariables\QuestMapScout.lua"  
   (XXX = "live", "liveeu" or "pts")

3. Upload the file somewhere (e.g. Dropbox/GitHub/Pastebin/etc.)

4. Send me a PM on ESOUI with a link to the file

5. Delete the file from the SavedVariables folder (while the game is still closed or the add-on disabled)
